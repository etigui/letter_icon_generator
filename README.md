# Letter image generator

Every time I create a program in C# with Visual Studio, the Form always come with an ugly icon. So, I decided to create a small program to auto generate an icon with a letter which represent the first letter of the application name. You can create five kind of icon with 256x256 resolution:
- Icon
- Png
- Jpeg
- Bmp
- Gif (not recommended)
